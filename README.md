# NaxerHub

Welcome to the NaxerHub GitHub Pages site!

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website built with GitHub Pages. Here you can find the content and configuration that power the live site.

## About This Site

- **Purpose:** This site serves as my online portfolio, blog, and project showcase.
- **Built With:** GitHub Pages and, optionally, Jekyll for static site generation (you can also use plain HTML/Markdown).

## How It Works

- The website is automatically built and published using GitHub Pages.
- Any changes you push to the designated branch will be deployed to the live site after a short delay (usually a few minutes).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Make changes to the HTML, Markdown, or Jekyll files as needed.
3. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
4. Visit the live site at: [https://nkwachukwu1.github.io/naxerhub-](https://nkwachukwu1.github.io/naxerhub-)

## Customization

- **Homepage:** Edit `index.html` or `index.md` to change your homepage content.
- **Site Configuration:** If you're using Jekyll, update `_config.yml` to modify site-wide settings like the title, description, and theme.
